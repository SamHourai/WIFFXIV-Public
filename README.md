# ðŸ“‹ What is WIFFXIV ?
<a href="https://wiffxiv.herokuapp.com/">
Where in Final Fantasy XIV is a website for testing your knowledge of the world of Final Fantasy XIV.
</a>
The game takes place in 3 rounds during which randoms panoramas from the game are displayed and you must designate, as precisely as possible on the map the location displayed.


# ðŸ“¸ How can I help by taking pictures ?
Taking in-game panoramas is a very time-consuming task, which is why I'm currently mainly looking for people who can help me add new locations.
## Tutorial : 
1. Find an interesting place (with a notable feature, a good view, etc.)
2. Enter gpose mode in-game.
   - 2.1 Hide your character, minions, other players and NPCs.
   - 2.2 Take 5 photos:
      - 2.2.1 A central one
      - 2.2.2 A little to the left one
      - 2.2.3 One all the way to the left one
      - 2.2.4 A little to the right one
      - 2.2.5 One to the far right one
3. Do not forget to note the place where they were taken!
4. Then use the "Hugin" or another software http://hugin.sourceforge.net/ to assemble them and create a panorama. (With Hugin, I had good results by setting the FOV to 90 Â°).
    - 4.1 Tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMYlm3D3N
5. Compress your images with https://imagecompressor.com/fr/
6. Send your photos by completing this form:
    - 6.1 https://forms.gle/Sy2fPqD7sTZXFc458

7. Thank you, it is thanks to you that WIFFXIV becomes better! (Make sure your file size are at least 2000x600.)

# ðŸ˜€ Who created it ?
I am from Belgium, I am a student in Networks and Cybersecurity, I am also passionate about Final Fantasy XIV and when I am not studying I spend my free time on the game.
And I developped alone WIFFXIV.
