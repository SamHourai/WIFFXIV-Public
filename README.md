# ðŸ“‹ What is WIFFXIV ?
<a href="https:\\example.com">
Where in Final Fantasy XIV is a website for testing your knowledge of the world of Final Fantasy XIV.
</a>
The game takes place in 3 rounds during which randoms panoramas from the game are displayed and you must designate, as precisely as possible on the map the location displayed.


# ðŸ“¸ How can I help by taking pictures ?
Taking in-game panoramas is a very time-consuming task, which is why I'm currently mainly looking for people who can help me add new locations.
## Tutorial : 
1. Find an interesting place (with a notable feature, a good view, etc.)
2. Enter gpose mode in-game.
   - 2.1 Hide your character, minions, other players and NPCs.
   - 2.2 Take 5 photos:
      - 2.2.1 A central
      - 2.2.2 A little to the left
      - 2.2.3 One all the way to the left
      - 2.2.4 A little to the right
      - 2.2.5 One to the far right
3. Do not forget to note the place where they were taken!
4. Then use the "Hugin" or another software http://hugin.sourceforge.net/ to assemble them and create a panorama.
