# ðŸ“‹ What is WIFFXIV ?
<a href="https:\\example.com">
Where in Final Fantasy XIV is a website for testing your knowledge of the world of Final Fantasy XIV.
</a>
The game takes place in 3 rounds during which randoms panoramas from the game are displayed and you must designate, as precisely as possible on the map the location displayed.


# ðŸ˜€ Who created it ?
I am from Belgium, I am a student in Networks and Cybersecurity, I am also passionate about Final Fantasy XIV and when I am not studying I spend my free time on the game.
And I developped alone WIFFXIV.
If you wish, you can help me keep this project ad-free and update it <a href="https://ko-fi.com/samhourai">by buying me a coffee here â˜•</a> !
